# RO03-ToRemember
The .md files had been edited with atom and :
* [mathjax-wrapper](https://atom.io/packages/mathjax-wrapper)
* [markdown-preview-plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus)

Both are required to render all mathematics formulas that I used *(surrounded by $ to handle the LaTeX syntax)*

**Will be update all semester long**
